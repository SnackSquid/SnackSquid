## Hi, I'm Spencer

I like to goof around with a lot of stuff. I've been off and on with The Odin Project and other things. I'm usually working on new stuff, here's a few things I have done:

### My Homepage!
- https://www.snacksquid.com

### Node/Express
- https://mighty-eyrie-69499.herokuapp.com/ (simple message board app)

### React
- https://snacksquid.github.io/weather-app/
- https://snacksquid.github.io/memory-card-game/

### JavaScript
- https://snacksquid.github.io/to-do-list/
- https://snacksquid.github.io/library/
- https://snacksquid.github.io/calculator/
- https://snacksquid.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/
