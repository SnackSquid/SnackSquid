## Hi, I'm Spencer Williams

I'm learning web development using the Odin Project framework, but I've also done a lot of other studying in the past (looking at you high school Visual Basic class!) I already work in the IT field, but I'm looking to transition to being a full time developer. Please check out a few of my projects. My current proficiencies are: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (ES6), React, and API. I'm always working on new stuff, but these projects are completed:

### React
- https://snacksquid.github.io/weather-app/ (also showcases async API calls)
- https://snacksquid.github.io/memory-card-game/

### ES6
- https://snacksquid.github.io/calculator/
- https://snacksquid.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/
- https://snacksquid.github.io/sign-up-form/
